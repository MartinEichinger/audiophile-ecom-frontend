## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Frontity](https://frontity.org/) - React / WordPress framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) - Headless CMS
- [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) - eCommerce Plugin in WordPress

### What I learned

For this project I used React as frontend and WordPress as headless CMS for the first time. Together with that I also introduced myself to styled components.
For the eCommerce context I used WooCommerce with a basic implementation of the WooCommerce API in my React project.

### Continued development

Let's see what's coming next...
