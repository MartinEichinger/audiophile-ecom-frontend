## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Frontity](https://frontity.org/) - React / WordPress framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) - Headless CMS

### What I learned

For this project I used React as frontend and WordPress as headless CMS for the first time. Together with that I also introduced myself to styled components.

### Continued development

...

### Useful resources

- [Frontity website](https://frontity.org/) - This helped me for getting introduced to frontity framework.
